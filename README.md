# FlyZy-Flight-Cancellation-Prediction-

The business objective of this project is to develop a reliable predictive model for flight cancellations to support Flyzy's mission of providing a smooth and hassle-free air travel experience. By accurately predicting flight cancellations, Flyzy can take proactive measures to minimize disruptions for their customers and improve overall operational efficiency for partner airlines. This predictive model will enable Flyzy to:

Enhance Customer Satisfaction: By predicting flight cancellations in advance, Flyzy can notify customers promptly, enabling them to make alternative travel arrangements. This proactive communication will lead to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Optimize Operational Efficiency: Airlines can take preventive actions, such as adjusting flight schedules, assigning alternative aircraft, and reallocating crew resources, based on the predictions. This optimization will reduce operational disruptions and costs.

Improve Business Reputation: By effectively managing and minimizing flight cancellations, Flyzy and its partner airlines can build a reputation for reliability and punctuality, attracting more customers and business opportunities.

Increase Profitability: Minimizing flight cancellations will lead to increased revenue generation as flights will operate more efficiently, reducing revenue losses due to

cancellations and missed opportunities.

Overall, the successful implementation of this predictive model aligns with Flyzy's vision of redefining the future of air travel through a personalized and connected experience, improving customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and overall business success.
